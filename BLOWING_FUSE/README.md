#BLOWING_FUSE

Conditions
-----------

The goal is to predict whether a specific usage pattern of electrical appliances will cause the main fuse to blow.
The fuse will be blown if the sum of the consumed current of turned-on devices at some point exceeds the capacity od the main fuse.

It is about counting the total sum at any given moment and comparing it with the highest possible capacity at any given moment.
